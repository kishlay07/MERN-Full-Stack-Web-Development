    <!--5. Loading : The loading attribute in the <img> tag is used to control how the browser loads and displays images on a web page. It is a new attribute introduced in HTML5 and is used to optimize the loading and rendering of images to improve web page performance.The loading attribute can have three possible values:

                           auto : This is the default value, and it tells the browser to load the image as soon as possible.
                           lazy : This tells the browser to delay loading the image until it is about to come into the viewport or the visible area of the web page. This can help reduce the initial load time of the page and improve performance, especially for images that are located below the fold or not immediately visible to the user.
                           eager : This tells the browser to load the image immediately, even if it is not currently visible in the viewport. This can be useful for images that are critical to the content or layout of the page and need to be loaded and displayed as soon as possible.-->
